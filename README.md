# Stanford-BUS123-W-ValueInvesting-
The 10 weeks Stanford Continuing Studies course "BUS 123 W — Value Investing: An Introduction " follows the textbooks Marshall, Good Stocks Cheap (ISBN 125983607X)

Kenneth Jeffrey Marshall leads a private investment firm and is a long-time value investor. His proprietary portfolio has beaten the S&P 500 total return since the beginning of the century without leverage, shorting, or derivatives. He also teaches value investing in the master’s in finance program at the Stockholm School of Economics in Sweden. Marshall received an MBA from Harvard.

This course introduces value investing through the case method of instruction.  Each week a firm of current interest to the best value investors in the world is introduced.  Students read parts of that company's annual report and other relevant sources.  They’re encouraged to share their views on the opportunity in a vibrant online discussion.  The week culminates in an optional, one-hour video conference that can either be attended live or viewed later.  Each case naturally teases out tools and principles of value investing in a relevant and engaged way, resulting in a fully-developed stock analysis framework that students can apply after the course ends.

### Final Project ###
Using the framework developed in the course, please pick any one publicly- traded company and determine a price at which you would buy its shares. Please turn in a write- up of your selection of no more than two pages at the end of the course.
